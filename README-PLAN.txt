-----------------
Repository for the development of a hangman game programmed using Python.
Developed by: Anthony Narlock

README:

The goal is to have a fully functioning hangman game in which the user will attempt to guess the word before the hang man is "hung". 

The determinant for whenever the hang man is "hung" is the number seven: One of which representing the following body parts: the head, body, left arm, right arm, left leg, right leg. When all of these are filled, the guessing user has lost the game. If the guessing user is to guess all of the correct letters in the word, they win.

The words will be divided into three difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard. Each of these difficulties will all have selected words from a large list that will be played. (Of course, if the user chooses the "easy" difficulty, they will recieve easy words to guess, and vice versa.)

-----------------

FUTURE TO-DOs:
- Implement a simple GUI that demonstrates the hangman game implementation
- Create a "Ranked" mode in which the guessing user will select a difficulty, and guess as many words as possible before they lose, the "ranked score" will be determined by the amount of words correct they guess. (Hopefully sometime in the future, saved scores can be located somewhere, but this sort of implementation will be on the backburner for now...)
- Implement a user-friendly and arresting GUI, using images and themes.
